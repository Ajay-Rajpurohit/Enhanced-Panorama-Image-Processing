# Enhanced-Panorama-Image-Processing
Performed Image-Stitching task using ORB and RANSAC techniques to create seamless panoramas from smartphone photos, addressing challenges like motion-induced inconsistencies and varying lighting conditions

**Problem Statement:**
Creating high-quality panoramic images remains challenging due to issues like misalignments and exposure differences. This project aims to use a different image processing algorithm that significantly improves panorama seamlessness and overall visual quality.

**Impact:**
These challenges are crucial for enhancing applications in virtual reality, architectural visualization, and digital photography.

**Dataset:**
We generate custom images to rigorously test and evaluate the effectiveness of our stitching algorithms.

**Algorithm:**
● Collect multiple overlapping images of the same scene.
● Identify distinctive features in each image using a feature detection algorithm
(e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).
● Compare features between pairs of images to find matches. This often involves
calculating distances between feature descriptors and may include a matching
strategy to filter out poor matches (e.g., Lowe's ratio test).
● Estimate the homography (projective transformation) between pairs of images
based on matched features. This step may involve a robust estimation method like
RANSAC to handle outliers effectively.
● Warp images into a common coordinate system using the estimated homographies.
● Merge the aligned images into a single panoramic image. Techniques like
multi-band blending or feathering are used to smooth the transitions between images and eliminate visible seams.
