# Enhanced-Panorama-Image-Processing
Performed Image-Stitching tasks using ORB and RANSAC techniques to create seamless panoramas from smartphone photos, addressing challenges like motion-induced inconsistencies and varying lighting conditions

**Problem Statement:**

Creating high-quality panoramic images remains challenging due to issues like misalignments and exposure differences. This project aims to use a different image processing algorithm that significantly improves panorama seamlessness and overall visual quality.

**Impact:**

These challenges are crucial for enhancing applications in virtual reality, architectural visualization, and digital photography.

**Dataset:**

We rigorously generate custom images to test and evaluate the effectiveness of our stitching algorithms.

**Algorithm:**

1. Collect multiple overlapping images of the same scene.

2. Identify distinctive features in each image using a feature detection algorithm
(e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).

3. Compare features between pairs of images to find matches. This often involves
calculating distances between feature descriptors and may include a matching
strategy to filter out poor matches (e.g., Lowe's ratio test).

4. Estimate the homography (projective transformation) between pairs of images
based on matched features. This step may involve a robust estimation method like
RANSAC to handle outliers effectively.

5. Warp images into a common coordinate system using the estimated homography.

6. Merge the aligned images into a single panoramic image. Techniques like
multi-band blending or feathering is used to smooth the transitions between images and eliminate visible seams.
